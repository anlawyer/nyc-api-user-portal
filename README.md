Looking for public APIs to use? This app allows you to search over 500 public APIs using the Public API [project](https://github.com/davemachado/public-api).

Search for a topic and see a list of APIs that match your topic. Add APIs to a favorite list for safe-keeping. Navigate to the favorite page, and delete from the list if wanted. Navigate back to the search page and search again!
